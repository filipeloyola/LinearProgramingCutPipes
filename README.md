One abstract of this work can see below:

In previous research a pediatric electric wheelchair was developed with the PVC frame. Although, one of the difficulties encountered in manufacturing was the planning of the PVC cutting for maximum use of raw material. In this research, a mathematical model of Linear Programming was applied to solve the problem of cutting PVC. The one-dimensional cutting model was implemented in Python to return cutting patterns from anthropometric measures. For the purposes of programming tests, at first, the demand for one part per model was considered, that is, 22 items. Then, the correct demands of each model were inserted, resulting in 78 items.

TESTE!
